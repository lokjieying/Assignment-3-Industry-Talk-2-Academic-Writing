## 💡 Reflection
From this industry talk 2 assignment, I realized that success in computer science does not only depend on technical skills such as programming, but also on project management, system development and teamwork. Learning about methodologies such as Agile and SDLC helped me understand how real world technology projects are planned and managed. This assignment also improved my academic writing skills, particularly in finding and citing academic resources, as well as working collaboratively with my teammate. Overall, the talk motivated me to continuously improve both my technical skills and data analysis, and my professional skills through group projects and assignments. This experience helped me better understand how what I learn in class can prepare me for future studies and careers in bioinformatics.
